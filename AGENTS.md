# Agent instructions

All behavior for coding in this repository is governed by **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`**. Those files are **binding** on every prompt, not optional guidance.

- Start with **`meta-all-rules-binding.mdc`** (always applies).
- Follow skills in **`.cursor/skills/`** when their description matches your task.

User-defined Cursor **User Rules** take precedence if anything conflicts.

## Project definition

### Summary

**Kaiad** is a multi-tenant SaaS control plane and runtime agent system for automated server lifecycle management. It monitors running services (Spring Boot, Express.js, Go servers), detects crashes and error-log events, and uses AI coding agents (Cursor CLI or Claude CLI) to automatically diagnose the cause, apply a code fix, commit to `main`, and restart the affected server — all without human intervention.

Two recovery flows:

1. **Crash recovery** — when a managed server process crashes, a Cursor or Claude CLI session is started against the error logs, a fix is produced and committed to `main`, and the agent restarts the server.
2. **Error-log fix** — when a non-fatal error is written to logs, a fix job is queued via Redis/BullMQ. The same CLI agent picks it up, commits a fix to `main`, and the workflow restarts the process.

Both flows close the loop by instructing the agent that owns the server process to restart it.

### Description

Kaiad is a **multi-tenant control plane** with a customer-managed **outbound Go agent**. Tenants install the Go agent on their own infrastructure; the agent connects outbound over WSS (TLS WebSocket) to the hosted control plane. The control plane sends `AgentCommand` messages down that channel — shell execution, workflow steps, GitHub operations, and CLI-agent invocations — and receives telemetry and log streams back up.

Key platform capabilities:

- **Service monitoring** — tenants register services; the agent streams Docker container logs and lifecycle events to the control plane.
- **Incident deduplication** — the API fingerprints incoming errors and deduplicates incidents so repeated log noise produces one remediation job.
- **Workflow engine** — a React Flow-based graph editor lets tenants define automation workflows (triggers, shell commands, HTTP requests, Slack notifications, branch conditions). Workflows are stored as graph JSON and executed by the agent via `sm-workflow-exec`.
- **AI-assisted remediation** — worker jobs enqueue Cursor CLI or Claude CLI runs on the agent's host; the runner applies fixes, commits to `main`, and the workflow restarts the server.
- **GitHub App integration** — the control plane can clone repos, open PRs, push branches, and trigger GitHub Actions workflow dispatches under tenant policy (allowlisted repos, branches, and actions; fully audited).
- **Multi-tenant session model** — users belong to one or more tenants with RBAC roles (owner, admin, viewer). Session tenant is switchable via `/session/active-tenant`; all settings and agent data are tenant-scoped.
- **First-run setup wizard** — a guided web UI configures Postgres, Redis, the first admin account, GitHub App credentials, optional OAuth (Google), and optional Kubernetes metadata; persisted to `kaiad.config.json` with environment variable precedence.
- **Single-port deployment** — the React SPA, Fastify API, WebSockets, and optionally the BullMQ worker all serve from one HTTP port, simplifying Docker and Kubernetes deployments.

### Apps

#### `apps/web` — React/Vite admin SPA (port 4173 in dev)

- **Authentication** — login page, OAuth (Google), session management via `useAuth`.
- **Dashboard** — live summary of services, incidents, and connected agents.
- **Services page** — list and manage monitored services per tenant.
- **Connected Agents page** — table of enrolled agents with live WebSocket presence (`websocketConnected`), status, version, capabilities, and linked service count.
- **Tenants page** — list tenant memberships with role; gear icon opens per-tenant configuration (Automation Policy, Executors, kill switch).
- **Workflow editor** — React Flow canvas for building, saving, and running automation graphs (node types: trigger, runShell, httpRequest, slackNotify, branchIf, etc.).
- **Settings page** — authentication providers (OAuth), enrollment tokens, GitHub App credentials (App ID, PEM, webhook secret).
- **Setup wizard** — first-run multi-step wizard (infra, admin, GitHub App, optional OAuth, optional webhook tenant, optional Kubernetes metadata).
- **Design system** — Control Slate tokens, Lucide icons, semantic CSS/Tailwind, role-aware information architecture.

#### `apps/api` — Fastify HTTP API + WebSocket gateway (port 3001)

- **REST API** (`/api/v1/*`) — CRUD for tenants, services, agents, incidents, enrollment tokens, workflows, settings, GitHub App config, and setup wizard routes.
- **Realtime gateway** (`/realtime` WebSocket) — bidirectional channel for the Go agent: receives telemetry and log frames up; pushes `AgentCommand` messages down. Managed by `RealtimeManager`.
- **Auth** — session cookies, Postgres-backed auth store after setup (memory store in dev/tests), OAuth callback handler, RBAC middleware.
- **Setup routes** — minimal bootstrap surface before setup completes (`/api/v1/setup/*`); full routes promoted via hot reload after wizard finishes.
- **Config persistence** — reads/writes `kaiad.config.json` in `KAIAD_DATA_DIR`; merges into `process.env` at startup; env vars always win over file.
- **Static serving** — serves the built React SPA from `dist/public/` so the whole app runs on one port in production.
- **Embedded worker mode** — when `SM_EMBED_WORKER=1`, starts BullMQ workers in-process instead of requiring a separate worker container.
- **GitHub webhook ingress** — receives and validates GitHub App webhooks; routes to the default webhook tenant.

#### `apps/worker` — BullMQ background worker (health port 9090)

- **Remediation jobs** — dequeue error/incident jobs and dispatch Cursor CLI or Claude CLI commands to the connected agent.
- **GitHub jobs** — clone, PR, push, workflow dispatch under tenant GitHub App installation tokens.
- **Workflow execution jobs** — enqueue `sm-workflow-exec` shell commands on the agent.
- **Health server** — lightweight HTTP on port 9090 (`/health`) for independent probing in multi-container deployments.
- **Standalone or embedded** — runs as its own process in the default Compose stack; can be embedded in `apps/api` via `SM_EMBED_WORKER=1` for single-container deployments.

#### `apps/agent` — Go outbound runtime agent

- **Outbound WebSocket connection** — connects to the control plane's `/realtime` endpoint using an enrollment token; maintains a persistent, backpressure-aware channel with exponential reconnect backoff.
- **Docker lifecycle monitoring** — watches Docker container start/stop/crash events and streams logs to the control plane.
- **Command execution** — receives `AgentCommand` frames and dispatches: shell commands, workflow executor (`sm-workflow-exec`), Cursor CLI or Claude CLI runner invocations.
- **AI-agent runner** — launches Cursor or Claude CLI in an isolated job context with the error log as input; captures the fix, commits to `main`, then signals the control plane to restart the server.
- **Credential persistence** — supports file-backed enrollment credentials (`SM_AGENT_PERSIST_CREDENTIALS=1`); production requires explicit `SM_ENROLLMENT_TOKEN`.
- **Enrollment** — registers with the control plane on first connect; token lifecycle is Postgres-durable (no in-memory-only tokens in production).

### Shared packages (`packages/`)

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `contracts` | Zod schemas for HTTP request/response, WebSocket frames, BullMQ job payloads, and OpenAPI output. Single source of truth across api, worker, web, and agent. |
| `domain` | Business logic types and validation (workflow graph, service, incident rules). |
| `db` | Drizzle ORM schema (`tenants`, `users`, `sessions`, `tenant_memberships`, `monitored_services`, `agents`, `incidents`, `workflow_graphs`, etc.) and query helpers. |
| `queue` | BullMQ queue definitions, job payload types, and shared Redis client factory. |
| `workflow-engine` | DAG executor for workflow graphs: parallel branches, join nodes, conditional branching, step result tracking. |
| `config` | Shared Zod-validated runtime configuration types (`kaiad.config.json` shape, env merging helpers). |
| `github` | GitHub App client wrappers (installation tokens, repo clone/PR/dispatch helpers) shared by api and worker. |
| `eslint-config` | Repo-wide ESLint preset (`@sm/eslint-config`, uses `eslint-plugin-import-x`). |
| `tsconfig` | Shared base TypeScript configs extended by every workspace package. |

> All workspace packages are published internally under the `@sm/*` scope (e.g. `@sm/contracts`, `@sm/api`). The `kaiad` name only exists at the repo root.

### Repository layout (top level)

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `apps/` | Runnable services: `web`, `api`, `worker`, `agent` (see above). |
| `packages/` | Shared TypeScript libraries consumed by apps via `workspace:*`. |
| `e2e/acceptance` | `@sm/acceptance` — black-box acceptance tests (AT-* IDs). Run via `pnpm acceptance` (`RUN_ACCEPTANCE=1`). |
| `e2e/playwright` | `@sm/playwright-e2e` — browser E2E suites (E2E-001…E2E-006) plus `bugs/` and `bugs.md` for tracked findings. Run via `pnpm e2e:playwright`. |
| `deploy/docker` | `compose.yml` (multi-service stack), `compose.unified.yml` + `Dockerfile.unified` (single-port image with embedded worker). |
| `deploy/k8s` | Kubernetes manifests: `namespace.yaml`, `secrets.yaml`, `api-deployment.yaml`, `worker-deployment.yaml`. |
| `env/dev`, `env/prod` | Per-environment `docker-compose.yml` plus a `data/` volume root for local Postgres/Redis state. |
| `scripts/` | Repo automation: `bump-version-from-tags.mjs` (semver bumps from git tags) and `verify-mermaid-diagram.sh` (CI mermaid linter). Tests in `scripts/tests/`. |
| `docs/` | Long-form architecture and onboarding docs (not contracts). |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Workspace globs: `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `e2e/*`. |
| `turbo.json` | Pipeline graph: `build`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:coverage` (all respect `^build` deps). |

| `kaiad.config.json` | Generated at runtime in `KAIAD_DATA_DIR` by the setup wizard; **never** commit a real one. |

### Common scripts (root `package.json`)

Run from the repo root with `pnpm <script>`:

| Script | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `build` / `build:apps` | Turbo build everything / build only the four apps (skips `apps/agent` if `go` missing unless `SM_REQUIRE_GO=1`). |
| `lint` | `turbo run lint` across all packages. |
| `typecheck` | `turbo run typecheck` (depends on `^build`). |
| `test` / `test:apps` | Turbo test everything / test only apps (Go agent gated on toolchain like `build:apps`). |
| `test:coverage` | Run Vitest with coverage; CI gate enforces ≥ 80% line coverage per package (see Non-negotiables). |
| `contracts:openapi` | Regenerate the OpenAPI document from `@sm/contracts` Zod schemas. Run after any contract change. |
| `acceptance` | Black-box acceptance suite with `RUN_ACCEPTANCE=1`. |
| `e2e:playwright` | Run Playwright browser E2E suite. |
| `version:bump[:minor\|:major\|:dry-run]` | Compute next version from git tags and write package.json updates. |
| `test:versioning` | `node --test` over the version-bump script. |

### `.cursor/rules` index (binding — see `meta-all-rules-binding.mdc`)

| Rule | Trigger / scope |
|------|-----------------|
| `meta-all-rules-binding.mdc` | Always — load all other rules. |
| `dev-environment-commands.mdc` | Use the canonical dev/prod start commands (see also `start-dev-environment` skill). |
| `host-config-change-gate.mdc` | Editing host-level configs (Caddy, systemd, env files) requires the documented gate. |
| `docker-compose-touch-gate.mdc` | Touching any compose file triggers the `docker-compose-change-gate` skill. |
| `commit-requires-coverage-enforcer.mdc` | Commits must keep the 80% coverage gate green. |
| `verification-before-stopping-code-changes.mdc` | Build + tests required before declaring code work done. |
| `ui-verification-gate.mdc` | UI / API / workflow changes verified at https://panel.dev.kaiad.dev before completion. |
| `ui-api-layer.mdc` | `apps/web` must call the API only via the typed client layer (no inline `fetch`). |
| `error-handling-must-throw-and-log.mdc` | No silent catches; throw + log structured errors. |
| `no-destructive-git.mdc` | Forbid force-push, history rewrites, and similar destructive operations. |
| `no-api-testing.mdc` | Do not write low-value API smoke tests; cover behaviour via contract or acceptance tests. |
| `testing-and-ports.mdc` | Tests must use the documented port map (see Ports Configuration). |
| `kaiad-users.mdc` | Use the dev credentials (`test@example.com` / `mypassword123`) — do not invent users. |
| `deviation-requires-bug-report.mdc` | Any deviation from rules must be filed as a bug report. |
| `post-push-github-actions-monitor.mdc` | After every `git push`, monitor the resulting Actions run until it finishes. |

### `.cursor/skills` index

| Skill | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| `start-dev-environment` | Bringing up the dev stack (panel.dev.kaiad.dev). |
| `start-prod-environment` | Bringing up the prod stack (panel.kaiad.dev). |
| `start-kaiad-agent` | Launching the local Go agent against the running control plane. |
| `kaiad-local-agent-enrollment` | Generating an enrollment token and wiring the agent to a tenant. |
| `build-and-test-all-apps` | Full repo build + test sweep (matches the verification gate). |
| `test-agent-and-panel` | End-to-end smoke of agent ⇄ panel together. |
| `web-ui-api-layer` | Adding or editing the typed API client used by `apps/web`. |
| `docker-compose-change-gate` | Required when modifying anything under `deploy/docker` or `env/*/docker-compose.yml`. |
| `monitor-github-actions-after-push` | Polling the Actions run after a push (pairs with the post-push monitor rule). |

### Non-negotiables

1. **Contracts are the source of truth** — all HTTP, WebSocket, and job payload shapes live in `packages/contracts`. Never diverge api, worker, web, or agent types from contracts without updating contracts first.
2. **Coverage gate** — CI fails if merged line coverage drops below 80% for any TypeScript package or app; Go agent must also pass `go cover`.
3. **No in-memory auth in production** — `createMemoryAuthStore` is for dev and tests only. Postgres auth store is required when `DATABASE_URL` is set.
4. **Env wins over config file** — environment variables always override `kaiad.config.json`. Do not reverse this precedence.

## Always (every prompt)

1. Follow **Cursor → Settings → Rules → User Rules** on every turn.
2. Follow **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** here. Files with **`alwaysApply: true`** apply every turn; **glob-scoped** rules apply when you touch matching paths.

## Before every response (checklist)

1. **Always:** Apply **User Rules** in full on this turn.
2. **Always:** For substantive work, **list or read** **`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`** so nothing is missed (including glob rules for files you edit).
3. **If** a skill under **`.cursor/skills/`** matches the task, **read and follow** it first.
4. **If** you **`git push`** or updated **`origin`**: You are **not** done until you **monitor GitHub Actions** for that commit (see **`post-push-github-actions-monitor.mdc`**) and report workflow outcomes.
5. **If** you change **`apps/`** or **`packages/`** (or configs that affect build): Run **build + tests** for the impacted scope before claiming done (see **`verification-before-stopping-code-changes.mdc`**).
6. **If** you make functional changes (especially UI, API, or workflow): Verify them using the dev panel at **http://panel.dev.kaiad.dev** before claiming the work is complete (see **`ui-verification-gate.mdc`**).
7. **If** you cannot run a required step: Say so **explicitly**; do not imply green CI or full compliance.

## Multi-root workspaces

If your Cursor workspace root is a **parent folder** that contains this repo (e.g. home + `service-monitor/`): also follow **`AGENTS.md`** and **`.cursorrules`** at that workspace root when present.
